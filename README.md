# armstrong_numbers
 An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 9 is an Armstrong number, because 9 = 9^1 = 9. 10 is not an Armstrong number, because 10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1. This code helps to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.
